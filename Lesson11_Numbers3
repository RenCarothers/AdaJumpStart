puts "Let's play a numbers game!  I'm going to evaluate numbers you input to determine if they are divisible by 3.  First, How many numbers would you like to enter?"
num_qty = gets.chomp.to_i # asks the user, turns their answer into
# an integer.  assigns this input the variable num_qty

i = 0 # initialize loop control variable to the value of 0
until i == num_qty # loop is executed until reaching user count number
  puts "Pick a number (positive integer)." # instructions for user
  posint = gets.chomp.to_i # asks the user, converts to integer
    if (posint % 3 == 0) 
    # if the user input is divisble by 3. Divisible by three means when it is divided by 3 the remainder would be zero
      puts "#{posint} is divisible by 3." # tell user its divisible
    elsif posint 
    # if it's not divisible by 3 aka has a remainder when divided by three
      puts "#{posint} is not divisible by 3." 
    end # end of the if else
  i += 1 # increments the value of our loop control variable i by 1
  # this makes the loop continue to run 1 more time until our until
  # is true (when i is equal to the num_qty user entered)
end # end of the until loop
puts "Hope you enjoyed playing, friend." # closing

# to figure this code out, first I wrote the loop, then i wrote 
# the divisible by 3 code seperately
# then i put the divisible by 3 code into the loop
# doing it in this way while i am still figuring stuff out was much
# easier for me to figure out than trying to do both together at once
